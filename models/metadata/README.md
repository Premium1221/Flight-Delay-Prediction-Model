# Model Metadata

Place supporting artifacts (feature lists, encoders, preprocessing functions)
for the trained models here. Examples:

- `model_features.pkl`
- `label_encoders.pkl`
- `preprocessing_function.pkl`
- `features_to_drop.pkl`

These binary files are git-ignored. If you need to commit a lightweight version
for documentation purposes, export it to JSON/Markdown instead.
