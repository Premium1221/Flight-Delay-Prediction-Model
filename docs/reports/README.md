# Reports (Large Files Ignored)

Store Word/PDF deliverables for the academic portion of the project in this
folder. The `.gitignore` rule skips binary files here to keep the repository
lean; commit only Markdown summaries if you want the content on GitHub.

Suggested pattern:

1. Export the final report to PDF/Word for stakeholders (keep it locally).
2. Write a short `REPORT_NAME.md` synopsis that captures objectives, data, and
   findings, and commit that file so the GitHub repo still documents the work.
