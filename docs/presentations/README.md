# Presentations

Keep pitch decks, demos, and image assets for presentations in this folder.
PowerPoint/Keynote binaries and large media files are ignored by git so they do
not bloat the repository. Add lightweight exports (PDF, PNG thumbnails) to your
cloud storage and link to them from the main `README.md` if you want to share
them publicly.
