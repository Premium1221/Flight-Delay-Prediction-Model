# Documentation

Use this folder to store any supporting material that is useful for explaining
the project but not required to run the app.

- `data_dictionary.md` – Markdown summary of the curated fields used in the project.
- `reports/` – Academic or stakeholder reports (Word/PDF). Git ignores the
  binary files here by default; add exports manually if you want them in GitHub.
- `presentations/` – Slide decks and image assets.
- `exports/` – HTML exports from notebooks or quick references such as the
  generated dictionary page.

Add lightweight Markdown summaries when possible and link to large binaries
through your preferred cloud storage instead of checking them into git.
